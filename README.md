# Collection+JSON wrapper for the @RelifyAPI

Worked a bit with @terrhorn of http://relify.com/ to
concept a more hypermedia-based version of their API.

Not much to see yet, but this stubs out a Python + Flask
wrapper API endpoint that is intended to serve a
Collection+JSON variation of the API...so I can talk 'em
into switching doing it "hyper style."

## Run it - requires Python 2.6+

    $ pip install Flask Flask-Classy
    $ python app.py

Request http://localhost:5000/

## TODO

Pretty much everything...
